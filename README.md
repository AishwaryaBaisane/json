## 8.1 What is Json & Json Parsing? :-

### Json :-
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used format for exchanging data between different systems and platforms.
- In programming, it's crucial to efficiently convert between JSON data and native data structures.
- This process is called JSON serialization and deserialization.

### Jason Parsing :-
- Parsing JSON is a task for apps that need to fetch data from the Internet.
- And depending on how much JSON data you need to process.
- you have two options: write all the JSON parsing code manually. automate the process with code generation.
